 ia_startup.1.t:0 "Children of Agade"
 ia_startup.1.desc:0 "Mesopotamia in the 10th century BC was a very dangerous place. Where only two centuries ago there were powerful empires, today there are only ruins and fighting warlords. \n In Babylonia, there was an invasion of Aramaic and Chaldean tribes, which shattered the position of the Kassites in the region. Their attacks focused mainly on temples and resembled attacks of the medieval vikings. At the time of the start of the modification, there was a rebellion by the inhabitants of Babylon, led by an Elamite immigrant, who adopted the local Akkadian culture and threw a foreign yoke from the Babylonians after four centuries. \n Assyria, on the other hand, after the seemingly incessant Aramaic attacks, had to leave its recent territorial conquests in Syria and, after an exhausting war, its borders on the euphrates were broken. However, unlike other nations, their spirit did not collapse. Despite so many losses, there was no change of power, internal struggles and similar issues there. The Assyrians united under the banner of Ashur of their god-king (the Assyrian ruler was only a governor for them, the royal title was used only in diplomatic correspondence). After some time, the attacks stopped, and instead of the merchant culture, militaristic fanatics appeared who believed that their mission was to bring the chaotic world under the rule of Ashur by using all necessary measures."
 ia_startup.1.a:0 "But will they have enough fighting spirit?"
 ia_startup.2.t:0 "Hordes of Ahlamu"
 ia_startup.2.desc:0 "Following the sea peoples' invasion of Mesopotamia, many marginalized peoples sensed the opportunity. The Arameans were just such a people. From their headquarters in the mountains of southern Syria, they began to expand in all directions sowing terror and terror. When the dust settled, they occupied vast swaths of the Middle East, creating a network of small states that stabilized the political situation in the region over time.\n Due to their widespread use and the ease of learning their speech, Aramaic eventually became the language of international communication. Wherever the children of the desert came, they took over customs and gods from the conquered peoples, learning and teaching."
 ia_startup.2.a:0 "Maybe there is more to them than meets the eye."
 ia_startup.3.t:0 "Chosen Nation"
 ia_startup.3.desc:0 "There are many theories and legends about the origins of the chosen people. The very name of their chief deity appears in the Sinai as early as the Bronze Age in conjunction with his wife Ashera, who historians have assumed could play the role of a mother goddess. It is not known how they ended up in Canaan, but we do know that during the reign of the son of Ramses II Merneptah, they were already in the holy land (and fell victim to his pacification campaign in the levant). He mentions them as a nation, not a kingdom in the full sense of the word.\n The first historically appearing historical leader of Israel (or more precisely Judah because it is unknown whether the two kingdoms were scientifically connected) is David. It is known that ..... existed since the entire ruling dynasty was named after him.\n The year is 987 BC and there is a civil war in Israel. After Saul the previous king of Israel and his sons, who died in battle, his younger and unprepared son Ishbaal takes over. This causes a reaction from the clan of Judah whose leader David decides with the help of the Philistine mercenaries and a family from the kingdom of Ammon to seize power in the country. Times are hard, and the new ruler will have to reunite the divided country."
 ia_startup.3.a:0 "Will he have enough strength?"
 ia_startup.4.t:0 "Libyan Anarchy"
 ia_startup.4.desc:0 "Egypt is currently going through a third intermediate period. After the confusion caused by the weak rule of Ramses XI, his subordinate Smendes seized power in the north, and the high priest of Amun in the south (though he was nominally subordinate to the Pharaoh of Tanis and was later of the same family). The country is in economic crisis due to climate change and the loss of much of its territory during the invasions of peoples. Finally, during the reign of the current member of the 21st Amenemope dynasty, there is a revolt of unpaid Libyan mercenaries, mainly from the Meshwesh tribe (Ma for short), led by Osorkon the Elder, causing chaos in the country. Temples, tombs, even the Valley of the Kings were robbed.\n The Libyans are unable to contain the situation and are well aware of it. A country is weak when it really needs a strong leader."
 ia_startup.4.a:0 "Can they find one?"
 ia_startup.5.t:0 "Wariors of the desert"
 ia_startup.5.desc:0 "Few know that one of the peoples most frequently taking part in the coalition of sea peoples were the Libyans. In the first attack during the reign of Merneptyah, the Meshwesh and Libu tribes living in the vicinity of Cyrenaica massively migrated under the leadership of Merjey and his son Ded. They took entire families to Egypt, and after their defeat at the hands of the Egyptians, they had nowhere to return or how to return. Pharaoh decided to take them alive. Times were hard and he needed soldiers to defend the desert borders, and who knows the desert better than the Libyans?\n It is not known what went wrong. Although the Libyans adopted religion and culture, they retained many old customs. Their leaders, next to Egyptian titles, always emphasized their tribal affiliation. Perhaps it was this loyalty that caused them to turn to their own leader Osorkon the Elder during the crisis during the reign of Amenemope. However, the rebellion is easy to start, but it is more difficult to control the brash militants afterwards."
 ia_startup.5.a:0 "Will they manage to bring order?"
 ia_startup.6.t:0 "Nubian bowmen"
 ia_startup.6.desc:0 "After the crisis under Ramses XI, the viceroy of Nubia left the Egyptian empire, and even earlier we have information about his loss of control over Upper Nubia. The vacuum caused by Egypt's focus on domestic affairs meant that local political elites began to come to power again, and nomads reappeared in the eastern desert for the first time in years of the Meded tribes. It is an opportunity that may never come again. The empire of the pharaohs is weak, and perhaps it is the time of the Kushites to form their own empire."
 ia_startup.6.a:0 "No more Egyptian yoke!"
 ia_startup.7.t:0 "Survivors in the Levant"
 ia_startup.7.desc:0 "The lack of great empires meant that the city-states of the Levant could breathe freely for the first time. Pushed out of the mainland by the Aramaic tribes and from the south by the sea-peoples invaders, they decided to open up to the only way left to them. That is why they sent their ships to the farthest corners of the world in search of riches to be brought and lands to be colonized. After the tragic destruction of the city of Ugarit during the fall of the Bronze Age and the cover of Byblos due to the severing of their economic ties with Egypt (which had more important matters on its head for the time being), Tire took over the Canaanite primacy. According to the legends, it was his rulers who decided to become the first colonial empire and it brought them profits that others could only dream of. However, not all of them gave up their native Canaan, where the last sources of resistance, such as Jebus or Meggido, remained pushed to the sidelines."
 ia_startup.7.a:0 "Which path will the merchants from Levant choose?"
 ia_startup.8.t:0 "Greco-Ageans"
 ia_startup.8.desc:0 "Known to the Greeks as Pelsgians or Lelegs, they were the previous inhabitants of Greece. The conquest of the region by the early Greeks resulted in a rather unique mixture of old and new customs, and the Late Bronze Age crisis scattered the ancient Aegean inhabitants along its shores. According to legends, Sarpedon, after the civil war in Crete, led his followers to Xanthos where they founded a colony. He was one of the heroes who fought in the Trojan War. In later legends Lycians always introduced themselves by mentioning their ancestors from their mother's side, which was supposed to be a Cretan custom. The Philistines were also supposed to come from this island, and although they adopted many customs of the local Avitas, their architecture or cuisine (they ate pork unclean for the local people) differed significantly from the local population. In Greece, there are also enclaves in inaccessible regions of the country."
 ia_startup.8.a:0 "Will they finally find a safe haven?"
 ia_startup.9.t:0 "Traders and Merchants"
 ia_startup.9.desc:0 "The people of the Persian Gulf were primarily traders. Their huge ships sailed between India and the Middle East, carrying a wide variety of goods. It was the safest way, therefore these lands enjoyed legendary riches using their privileged location. Of course, this could change if an alternative to the waterway is discovered."
 ia_startup.9.a:0 "After all, it is money that rules the world."
 ia_startup.10.t:0 "Heirs of Mittani"
 ia_startup.10.desc:0 "The Hurites ruled northern Mesopotamia for years, but after the Assyrian Revolt, their kingdom of Mittani was cannibalized by the Assyrian and Hittite Empires. The survivors had to travel north to their kin in the mountains by Lakes Van and Urmia. However, times are changing. The Hittite Empire has fallen and the Assyrians are weakened. This opportunity may not repeat itself."
 ia_startup.10.a:0 "Maybe it's time to restore the former glory."
 ia_startup.11.t:0 "Upplanders"
 ia_startup.11.desc:0 "Elam has quite a long and turbulent history with Mesopotamia. It stands in the way of the mineral riches of the Zagros Mountains, which brings both advantages in the form of metal ores and disadvantages, i.e. jealous neighbors who want to take them away from you. In the past, whenever there was an invasion by Mesopotamia, the Elamites retreated into the mountains and counterattacked from there. Today Elam is also under attack from this side, and the new threats in the form of nomads from the north and the reborn Assyria mean that old enemies could gain a lot from cooperation. It is also worth mentioning the mountain country of Ellipi whose inhabitants have a cultural and geopolitical bond with Elam and share many of the same problems."
 ia_startup.11.a:0 "The Elamites have survived much and will survive this time too!"
 ia_startup.12.t:0 "Masters of Chariots"
 ia_startup.12.desc:0 "The Kassites did not leave many sources about themselves, but their rule was the most stable period in the history of Mesopotamia. Though not an Indo-European people, their religion was inspired by Indo-Europeans, indicating close proximity to at least the Middle Bronze Age. What is known for sure is that their culture revolved around horses. They had the best and most numerous stables in Mesopotamia, praised even by the Egyptian pharaohs. It was only as a result of the crisis of the late Bronze Age that they began to lose their dominance over Karduniash (Babylonia in their language) and were relegated to the Zagros Mountains where their cousins from the Parsua and Zamua peoples lived."
 ia_startup.12.a:0 "Will they be able to get Babylon back?"
 ia_startup.13.t:0 "Followers of Tarhunz"
 ia_startup.13.desc:0 "After the fall of Hattusa, the hittites withdrew south where they formed the state cities in the Taurus Mountains and Syropalestine. Some of them, like Karkemish, had ties to the ruling dynasty of Hattusa and served as governors in the area. It was the rulers of the Karkemish who most tried to recreate the empire using their heritage as the last great Khatti. Their efforts were torpedoed by the Aramaic tribes, which were an increasing part of the region's population and seizing power in more and more regions of Syria.\n As the old Empire occupied many areas inhabited by Luvians, over time the Hittites were absorbed into their culture. One of its interesting aspects was the avoidance of absorption of local deities into the pantheon, which was referred to in official documents as a thousand hatti gods. Another was legalism. Many official treaties have survived, regulating the relations between this vast empire and linking Hattusa's vassals to the ruler.\n In the west, other members of this Lydian culture emerged from the crisis, and one of their rulers claiming to be an illegitimate descendant of Hercules had ambitions to unite Anatolia under his scepter."
 ia_startup.13.a:0 "Will someone rebuild the old empire?"
 ia_startup.14.t:0 "Tribes of Thrace"
 ia_startup.14.desc:0 "The Greeks often joked that had it not been for the quarrelsome nature of the Thracians, they would have been conquered by them long ago. They said so because they occupied vast territory from Dacia to central Anatolia. They were just supposed to reach Anatolia after the fall of the Hittite empire, although in the later Bronze Age we are supposed to believe that they were present in Bithynia on the outskirts. When Kaskians sacked the abandoned capital, they got their chance. While this was not true, Macedonians were often discriminated by the Greeks because of their alleged Thracian origin. The fact is that these peoples lived side by side with many customs in common."
 ia_startup.14.a:0 "Will the Thracians be able to unite?"
 ia_startup.15.t:0 "Post-Mycenean Greece"
 ia_startup.15.desc:0 "If the situation in the Middle East after the fall of the Bronze Age was dire, it was nothing compared to that of the Greeks. It was so bad that in many places there was a civilization regression and the script used earlier has been forgotten. The reason for this was probably the collapse of trade related to the increase in piracy. The famine didn't help either. As a result, whole nations joined the peoples of the sea in the invasion of Egypt. The Greeks settled, inter alia, in Cyprus, in Cilicia, and one group also reached the holy land. There are assumptions in connection with some interesting entries in the Bible that the Dan tribe was of foreign origin (one of the tribes involved in the invasion of Egypt was called Dannuna) and the priests tried to integrate them peacefully. \n After the collapse of the Mycenaean confederation, according to reports, there was to be a great Dorian invasion, but no evidence of it was found. Many cities were attacked from the sea and not from the land. Hence the theory that social unrest had an internal basis. Doru was a Mycenaean term for the lower social class, so the peasant revolt could have been a natural consequence of the crisis. In some places, power was shared with the people to deal with it. It was during this period that the beginnings of democracy were born in Athens. \n There is also a linguistic change in favor of the theory of the internal nature of the crisis, namely the basileus from the position of a local governor has become synonymous with the king. Previously, the ruler was meant by the word wanax. The rulers, to justify their coming to power, coined the myth of Heraclids, i.e. the descendants of Heracles, and many of them began to derive their origin from them, for example, like the rulers of Sparta or Macedonia. "
 ia_startup.15.a:0 "But will they live up to the legend that they themselves began to believe?"
 ia_startup.16.t:0 "Raiders from Illyria"
 ia_startup.16.desc:0 "The Illyrian had a rather unflattering opinion as the least loyal mercenaries in the Mediterranean world. According to some, they were to be among the coalition of sea peoples attacking Egypt under the name of Shekelesh. The first reports about their ships come from this period because they were best known for their construction and piracy. After all, their homeland is very similar to Greece and favors this branch of the economy. They were also the first inhabitants of Corfu before the arrival of the Greek colonists."
 ia_startup.16.a:0 "Will their sailors and warriors defeat the Greeks?"
 ia_startup.17.t:0 "Shardana"
 ia_startup.17.desc:0 "The inhabitants of the western shores of the Mediterranean played a greater role in the history of the ancient world than is commonly believed. When we see a painting of a warrior with a horned helmet in Egypt, we do not often know that we are looking at a man from Sardinia, but what were they doing so far from home? \n The same as the inhabitants of any poor region with too large a population and wide access to the sea, that is, they attacked ships. Known in the East as Shardana, the Nuragic people were exquisite sailors and well-trained warriors. They served in the Egyptian army and fought on both sides of the conflict in battle with the peoples of the sea. We know from the number of sanctuaries on the island that they were a highly religious people. This is also indicated by the wearing of horned helmets, which at that time were generally worn in the west, but it was the inhabitants of Sicily who liked them especially and at least from the paintings it appears that they were commonly worn. The latest research shows that the horns were a symbol of the cult of twin gods, protective warriors, as indicated by statues with such helmets appearing in pairs."
 ia_startup.17.a:0 "Beware of the Vikings of antiquity!"

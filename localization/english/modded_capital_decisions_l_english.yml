According to the Bible, a people called the Jebusites were to live there. However, sources like the official documents of the pharaoh refer to Jerusalem with the name Urasalimmu since the 15th century BC. The site was chosen mainly for defensive reasons, initially it was a small but well-fortified town in a high-altitude area."
